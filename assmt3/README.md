# Assignment 3 

## Question 1 

The algorithm can be found in the the file 'q1/q1.ipynb' 

The code prompts the user to take a 10 seconds video. The video frames are stored in the folder "video_frames". 

These frames are used for this and the subsequent questions.

I manually selected a good frame from the frame list and cropped out a region of interest (roi.png)

<img src="./roi.png" width="150" />

The pattern (roi) is then used to search in 10 randomly selected images from the video frames. 

The images in which pattern is found using "Sum of squared differences" is stored in the folder "q1/pattern_match_ssd" 

The images in which pattern is found using "Normalized correlation" is stored in the folder "q1/pattern_match_ncor"
